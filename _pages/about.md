I am an undergraduate student studying bioinformatics🧬 at Zhejiang University🇨🇳.

My current research interests include developing algorithms🧑‍💻 for multi/sub-cellular spatial transcriptomics and multi-modality integration. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing music🎶 and solving Rubik’s cubes. I’m also a big fan of pc games🎮.

The picture on the left is my cat🐱, Coco. He's way more good-looking than me, so I decided to put him here for everyone’s admiration🐾.
