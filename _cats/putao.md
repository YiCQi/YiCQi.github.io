Putao is a gentle and affectionate seal bicolor Ragdoll who loves human company and behaves obediently.  
Though he doesn’t seem to eat much, he’s surprisingly chubby.  
He is always polite toward people — but not quite so with Coco.  
He often chases Coco around and engages in playful wrestling, perhaps as a father’s way of teaching discipline.  
Despite this, Putao remains a gentleman: at mealtime, he always waits for Coco to finish eating before starting on his own.
