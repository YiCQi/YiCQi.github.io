I am an undergraduate student studying bioinformatics🧬 at Zhejiang University🇨🇳.

My current research interests include developing algorithms for multi/sub-cellular spatial transcriptomics and multi-modality integration. 

The picture on the left is my cat, Coco. He's way more good-looking than me, so I decided to put him here for everyone’s admiration.
