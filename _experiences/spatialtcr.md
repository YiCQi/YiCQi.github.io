- Developed a high-resolution spatial TCR profiling method leveraging Stereo-seq, enabling accurate reconstruction of TCR alpha and beta chains directly from tissue sections.  
- Created a dedicated computational pipeline for reliable chain pairing, clonotype mapping, and integration with spatial transcriptomic data.  
- Applied the platform to human tissues, revealing spatial T cell clonotype distributions and immune microenvironments with high confidence.
