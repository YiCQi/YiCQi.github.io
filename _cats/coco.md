Coco is a young mitted Ragdoll cat with fluffy white gloves and gentle blue eyes.  

He spends most of his day napping peacefully or scratching enthusiastically at his cat scratching board.  

He's very food-motivated — every time food is served, he meows loudly with anticipation, though he’s still leaner than his dad, Putao.  

Coco is shy around strangers: the moment someone unfamiliar enters, he hides himself away completely.

When you ignore him for too long, he will come and give you a bite.
