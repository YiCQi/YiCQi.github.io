- Analyzed 246 healthy and diseased samples from three subcellular-level spatial transcriptomic sequencing platforms: Visium HD, Stereo-seq, and Xenium.  
- Developed an interactive, multi-resolution visualization tool (e.g., 8µm, 16µm bins for Visium HD) with adjustable leiden clustering and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis.  
- Enabled visualization of cell segmentation with advanced analyses, including cell shape characterization, spatial distribution, and cell-cell interactions.
