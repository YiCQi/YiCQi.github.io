- Conducted large-scale benchmarking of 7 integration methods (spaVAE, scVI, scPoli, …) across 6 multi-batch spatial transcriptomic-metabolomic datasets.  
- Developed quantitative batch integration assessment system:  
  - Basic ST assessment (Continuity (CHAOS, PAS, …), Marker score (Moran’s, Geary's, …), Specificity score (Specificity, Logistic regression, …)  
  - Biological conservation (ASW, Cell-type LISI (cLISI), …)  
  - Batch correction (Batch ASW, Integration LISI (iLISI), …)  
  - Reconstruction fidelity (Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation)
